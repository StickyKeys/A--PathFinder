Given a text based grid the program is able to find the optimal path utilizing the A* algorithm or using a greedy algorithm. 
The result is written to a file displaying the path from the start to the goal.

To utilize this program make sure that all of the files are in the same directory. 
Next, open up a terminal and 'cd' into the appropriate directory with the program files and
type 'python informedSearch.py' and press enter.
